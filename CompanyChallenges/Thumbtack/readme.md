Thumbtack challenge
problem name: company threshold

Recommended time : 5 minutes

My Estimated Time: 20 minutes

Start Time: 10:30 a.m
Timer Off : 10:50 a.m

I realised I had not understood the problem properly. It was supposed to return the index of the inner array  after the desired results rather than a integer count that I thought was supposed to be returned. I was first hung up on how how to loop through the 2D arrays(jagged arrays) of varying length to set up the condition. Second I did not know how to return the index of an array and had to do some research on that which took me more time than I had  estimated.

After doing some research figured out that we could add it to a list and then convert it to an array. Then I set the timer again and was able to finish it in less than 8 minutes.
